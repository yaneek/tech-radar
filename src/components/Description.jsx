      What is the Tech Radar?

    <Typography variant="subtitle2">
      This tool shows the current state of the methodologies, technologies, protocols and tools used by the Big Baobab team. This is based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering
      work of ThoughtWorks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar">Zalando&#39;s project</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yaneek/tech-radar">Grzegorz Marchwi≈Ñski</a>.

      The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, methodologies,  complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring
        assignment</em>. There are four rings with the following semantics:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="body2">
          <strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Used in production environment, low risk and recommended to
          be widely used.
          </Typography>
      </li>

      <li>
        <Typography variant="body2">
          <strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that I started to use, solve a
          real problem; TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky
          </Typography>
      </li>

      <li>
        <Typography variant="body2">
          <strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for me;
          I read, learn and monitor such technolologies. Sometimes i started a prototyping effort.
          ASSESS technologies have higher risks.
          </Typography>
      </li>

      <li>
        <Typography variant="body2">
          <strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; This does not always mean that technology is bad, it just means
          that it is not in my interest. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects,
          but usually can be continued for existing projects.
          </Typography>
      </li>

      <li>
        <Typography variant="body2">
          <strong>RISK</strong> &mdash; A possible risk with the technology has been identified.
          This risk relates to the use of the technology within the project. For example an open source project
          being purchased by an organization that is likely to close source the software.
